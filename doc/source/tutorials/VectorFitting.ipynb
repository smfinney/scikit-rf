    "## Mathematical Description\n",
    "The idea of Vector Fitting is to fit a set of rational model functions to a set of sampled frequency responses $\\mathbf{\\underline{H}}_\\mathrm{sampled}$, for example from a [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_parameters), [Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admittance_parameters) or [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_parameters) matrix. The model function $\\mathbf{\\underline{H}}(\\mathrm{\\underline{s}})$ is defined in the Laplace domain with $\\mathrm{\\underline{s}} = \\sigma + \\mathrm{j} \\omega$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
