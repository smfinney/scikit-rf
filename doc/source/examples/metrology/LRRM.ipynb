    "This example demonstrates how to use `skrf`'s LRRM calibration. LRRM stands for Line-Reflect-Reflect-Match which are the calibration standards needed for the calibration. There are few different implementations of the LRRM that use slightly different assumptions and match model. `skrf`'s LRRM calibration uses the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Line standard needs to be known exactly.\n",
    " * First reflect's phase needs to be known within 90 degrees. It can be lossy and it's assumed to be identical on both ports.\n",
    " * Second reflect's |S11| is assumed to be known, it's phase also needs to be known within 90 degrees and it's assumed to be identical on both ports. The two reflects need to be different and their phase difference should be 180 degrees for the best accuracy.\n",
    " * Match is assumed to be a known resistance in series with unknown inductance. Match only needs to be measured on the first port.\n",
    " \n",
    "The calibration standards and measurements need to be given in the above order to the calibration routine. If the above assumptions are followed the calibration can solve the reflects, match and calibration parameters exactly."
