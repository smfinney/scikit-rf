    "Now, the vector fit can be performed. The number and type of poles has to be specified, which depends on the *behaviour* of the responses. As a rule of thumb for an initial guess, one can count the number of resonances or \"bumps\" in the individual responses. In this case, the 4-port network has 16 responses to be fitted. As shown in the magnitude plots below, $S_{11}$ and some other responses are quite *spiky* and have roughly 15 local maxima each and about the same number of local minima in between. Other responses have only 5-6 local maxima, or they are very noisy with very small magnitudes (like $S_{24}$ and $S_{42}$). Assuming that most of the 15 maxima of $S_{11}$ occur at the same frequencies as the maxima of the other responses, one can expect to require 15 complex-conjugate poles for a fit. As this is probably not completely the case, trying with 20-30 poles should be a good start to fit all of the resonances in all of the responses."
