   switch terms
      Described in [1]_ by Roger Marks, switch-terms account for the fact that the 8-term (aka *error-box* ) model is overly simplified.  The two error networks change slightly depending on which port is being excited. This is due to the internal switch within the VNA.

   port impedance
      The impedance of a given port on a microwave Network. Frequently
      this is the same as the characteristic impedance of a given 
      transmission line mode, but may be arbitrarily set. 
      terminating a port with any impedance other than its port impedance
      will cause reflections. 

   characteristic impedance 
      Ratio of voltage to current, for a single traveling wave along a 
      transmission line.
